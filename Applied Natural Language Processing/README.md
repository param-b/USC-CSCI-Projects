# Applied Natural Language Processing

  HW1: Naive Bayes based Spam Classification.\
  HW2: Part of Speech Tagging using HMM and Viterbi Algorithm on Surprise Languages.\
  HW3: Sentiment Classification on Cipher Text (Implemented Hierarchical  Attention Network).\
  HW4: Natural Language Inference. Entailing or Neutral. (ALBERT v2).\


Final Project: Improved on SOTA CTRLSum model for query based text summarization by integrating knowledge graphs and Wordnet to include more contextual information and make it better suited to deal with Semantic Adversarial Attacks.\
The project has its own repository.\
