Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm\
    The basic dynamic approach over the runs consumes a lot of memory.\
    During testing of a program the available RAM was overran for the input string of size 2 ^ 15.\
        

Hirschbergâ€™s Algorithm\
    The divide and conquer approach helps to reduce the RAM Usage while taking a little more time.\
    There was no RAM overran occurring in this case for the input string of size 2 ^ 15.\
